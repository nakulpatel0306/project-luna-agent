this is the luna desktop agent project.

code style:
- use lowercase for all ui text
- prefer functional components in react
- use type hints in python
- write clear, self-documenting code
- add comments for complex logic

architecture:
- frontend: tauri + react + typescript
- backend: python + fastapi
- communication: ipc/http
- local-first philosophy

when writing code:
- follow the project structure in README.md
- reference project_luna_notion_structure.md for specs
- write tests for new features
- keep functions small and focused
- prioritize safety and user control
- always validate commands before execution

project values:
- privacy first (local execution by default)
- transparency (show what will be executed)
- safety (confirm dangerous operations)
- simplicity (lowercase aesthetic, minimal ui)
